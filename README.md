# dungeon-slitherer

Created by J. M. Mendoza

Dungeon Slitherer is a puzzle-movement game, a strategy dungeon clearer, with snake elements incorporated in.
Stay alive, don't get stuck, and get to the end to complete each level!

"main_snake.py" is the file to run

WASD or Arrow Keys to move, Left-Click to interact

There are only 6 levels, with every 3-set focusing on a concept, being:

1-3: Movement / 4-6: Length Growing/Shrinking

Extra Notes:
---

A green snake means you are able to take damage, an orange snake means you just took damage and are invincible from it

Default move speed is every 0.1 seconds, default time invincible after taking damage is 2 seconds 

Apples grow you by 1, Bananas grow you by 3, Skeletons shrink you by 1

One-Ways allow you to move in the directions indicated

Enemies move on their movement-trails

A production tool of entity coord gatherer has been left in, which helped with the development.
