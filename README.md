Created by J. M. Mendoza

Dungeon Slitherer is a puzzle-movement game, with a focus in strategy dungeon-clearing combined with snake elements.
Stay alive, don't get stuck, and get to the door to complete each level!

"main_snake.py" is the file to run

IMPORTANT
---

When exporting, make sure that the selected folder when opening is the actual folder that holds the code, not a folder that holds the main folder. The program doesn't work if you select another folder.

With WinRAR, "Extract files..." often puts the main folder with the code into another folder, so remember to select the main folder instead of the folder that holds that main folder.

General Info
---

WASD or Arrow Keys to move, Left-Click to interact

There are only 6 levels, with every 3-set focusing on a concept, being:

[1-3: Movement]  
[4-6: Length Growing/Shrinking]

Extra Notes:
---

A green snake means you are able to take damage, an orange snake means you just took damage and are invincible from it

Default move speed is every 0.1 seconds, default time invincible after taking damage is 2 seconds 

Use the + Icon in levels to pause

Apples grow you by 1, Bananas grow you by 3, Skeletons shrink you by 1

One-Ways allow you to move in the directions indicated

Enemies move on their movement-trails

The production tool "Entity Builder" has been left in, which helped with the development.
